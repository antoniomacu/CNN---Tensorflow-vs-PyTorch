# Convolutional Neural Networ - Torch Vs Tensorflow

This is a little application of a Convolutional Neural Network both in PyTorch and Tensorflow, utilizing the MNIST SIGNS Dataset.

* The content of the notebook is inspired in the coursework in **Convolutional Neural Networks - Week 1**, from [Deep Learning Specialization](Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). I utilized the knowledge adquired during the lessons and took inspiration from the code developed during the coursework to implement a **CNN** with a slighty differet dataset, in this case **MNIST SINGS Dataset**.

* The ConvNet follows the structure: `CONV2D -> BatchNorm -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV2D -> BatchNorm -> RELU -> MAXPOOL -> FLATTEN -> DENSE`. To implement it I used **Tensorflow** taking as reference the code from the coursework, to then try to implement it in **PyTorch**.
